# PorousMediaLab

The toolbox for batch and 1D reactive transport modelling in porous media aimed at the easiness of use for the user without computational background.

# How to use

Have a look at ["examples"](https://github.com/biogeochemistry/PorousMediaLab/tree/master/examples) folder.

# Installation using pip

- Install python version 3.5 or higher ([click](https://www.python.org/downloads/));
- install Anaconda [(click)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/);
- to install the toolbox run ```pip install porousmedialab```
- in terminal run command ```jupyter notebook```;
- You will see the folders in your home folder. You can navigate in any folder and create a new notebook with your model.



# Manual installation

- Install python version 3.5 or higher ([click](https://www.python.org/downloads/));
- install Anaconda [(click)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/);
- download and unzip or clone (using git) this repository (PorousMediaLab);
- Open terminal and go to the PorousMediaLab folder using ```cd``` command. If you have problems with the terminal, check this [guide](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/);
- in terminal run command ```jupyter notebook```;
- you will see the folders of the PorousMediaLab project; you can go in "examples" folder and play with them.
