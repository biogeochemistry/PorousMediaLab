# porousmedialab changelog

## 1.3.7

2019-09-06

### NEW

- saving results of the simulation in HDF file using method `save_results_in_hdf5()`

## 1.3.6

2019-09-04

### FIXED

- Due to floating point error the Calibrator sometimes couldnt find an index of intersection of simulated values with observed ones


## 1.3.5

2019-06-28

### NEW

- saving initial concentrations with the grid X. Loading initial concentrations and interpolate on the required new X grid if needed. It is required when dx was changed between the simulations.

## 1.3.4

2019-02-07

### NEW

- added time variable in the batch sstem for time dependendant simulations

2018-09-30

### NEW

- Renamed keyword "element=" to "name="
- Save and load initial concentrations functions
- Reconstract rates with scipy
- Renamed keyword "Init_C=" to "init_conc="
- Automatic calibration example and some DOCS
- Added docstrings for methods

 ### FIXED

- Fix for bc_top_value



## 1.3.3

2018-09-30

### NEW

- Renamed keyword "element=" to "name="
- Save and load initial concentrations functions
- Reconstract rates with scipy
- Renamed keyword "Init_C=" to "init_conc="
- Automatic calibration example and some DOCS
- Added docstrings for methods

 ### FIXED

- Fix for bc_top_value


## 1.3.1

2017-12-05

### NEW

- added calibration routines (see examples);

### IMPROVED

- improved computational time when boundary conditions are changed. The frameworks makes additional checks if it requires to rebuild left hand side and right hand side matrices.


## 1.2.1

2017-11-06

### NEW

- added multiphase porosity, now each species has its own porosity. This change was required in order to model water/gas/solid interactions with conservation and conversation of mass


## 1.1.5

2017-11-06

### FIXED

- pre_run_methods() bug fix: when model are setup to integrate from i=0 it throws an error "undefined 'solver' in scipy".

## 1.1.1

2017-09-19

### FIXED

- clashed method names


## 1.1
